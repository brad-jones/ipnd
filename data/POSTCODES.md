# Australian Postcodes

You must purchase the Australian Postcode map (For AUD$75) from [Australia Post](https://auspost.com.au/business/marketing-and-communications/access-data-and-insights/address-data/postcode-data). This data is not allowed to be redistributed.

When you have bought the CSV, save it in this folder as 'postcodes.csv' and then run 'generate.php' which 
will compile a hash, and save it as 'postcodes.hash.php' in this folder, that is used to verify and look
up postcodes.

Sample data will be used if postcodes.csv does not exist.
